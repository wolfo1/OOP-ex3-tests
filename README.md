# OOP_ex3_Algorithms_Tests
HOWTO Run tests
1. Download testSrc directory, put it in your project's directory.
2. In intelliJ, right click on the directory -> mark directory as -> test sources root.
3. If you haven't already, right click on junit in line 17 and download junit 5.
4. Run all tests together or individually as you please.

* Assumptions I made over the input of each algorithm are stated as a comment above each test. *
If you have any improvement recommendation, end cases or if any of the tests are not working, please contact me @ omri.wolf1@mail.huji.ac.il
